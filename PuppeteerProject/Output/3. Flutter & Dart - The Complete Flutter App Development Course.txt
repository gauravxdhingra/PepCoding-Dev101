Flutter is here to stay!

Welcome to The Complete Flutter App Development Course ( The World's First Complete Dart and Flutter Course). Now with a Full Course Update [2020].

Flutter is the new Cross-platform Mobile Development Framework created by Google, which allows developers to build Android and iOS Apps with one single codebase!

Flutter is the BEST way to create cross-platform apps that otherwise would require two distinct mobile development teams to create.

Why is Flutter a BIG Deal?

Flutter is a big deal because any developer ( or anyone who wants to learn mobile development ) can now build native Android and iOS apps with one codebase ONLY! This means, instead of having to learn Objective-C or Swift to build iOS apps, and Java, or Kotlin to build Android apps, you can now use Flutter Mobile Development Framework to build apps that run natively on both iOS and Android devices using the General-purpose Dart Programming Language.




This course is fully hands-on, in which you'll get the chance to practice and learn:

Dart Programming Language - Fundamentals and intermediate topics

How to understand Flutter Mobile Development by building apps, incrementally

How to design, build, debug Flutter Android and iOS Apps

How to get Flutter apps to communicate with a realtime database - Firestore

How to build robust apps with Flutter.

You’ll see how easy it’s to get started building Android and iOS apps using Google’s Flutter App Development Framework!
